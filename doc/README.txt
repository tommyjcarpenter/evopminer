The system is detailed in depth in our paper, linked here: http://www.tommyjcarpenter.com/papers/2014/eenergy_sentiment.pdf

At some point, I will write a usage guide here for the system. If you are a developer, you
can figure out (for now) what is going on because the code is very modular. Each .py file has a single
purpose: clean strings, compute stats, perform database queries, etc. Also, there is a .sql file in
the "required files" folder that will set up a sql databases file for you, so you need not worry about
database schema creation.
