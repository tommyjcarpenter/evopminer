PYTHON VERSION NOTE:
This is still in python2.7, but *not by choice*. I have converted all my other projects to python3.
The reason is that this project critically depends on scrapy, which as of June 2014, (STILL) does not have python3 support. 
Note, it also depends on NLTK, which is only in alpha for python3, but NLTK3a4 is considered stable and works fine
for my other projects. So really just waiting on Scrapy. 


Still to do: 

1) Currently, there is no *fast* way to debug the classification rules or the classification
grammar. Currently, the tagging / cleaning phase is run just before the phase where tagged sentences
are actually classified. These two steps need to be separated.  Currently, to test new features in
the classification phase, I need to re-run the tagging/preprocessing phase each time. These stages
take awhile, an hour or more for a large forum, because each sentence has to be searched for a large
number of contractions, misspellings, incorrect tags, etc. There is really no way to decrease the
time of this phase: for each sentence, several operations must be performed and several large lists
must be iterated.  HOWEVER, the *feature to implement* would be a database table that stores tagged
and processed sentences. Upon implementing this, one could process the sentences in the original
reviews by cleaning, tagging, and fixing them, then storing these tagged sentences into a database
table. Thus, the processing phase needs to be done only ONCE (unless you are modifying that phase
      itself).  Future iterations that wish to debug/modify the classification phase can then just
pull these classified sentences out of this new table. This would LARGELY decrease debugging time. 


2) Documentation (lots more needed).  

Enjoy!

date:        Wed Apr 16 12:08:29 2014 -0400
summary:     MASSIVE SPEED IMPROVEMENT In cleaning sentences function. Old method: iterate over all
mispellings and contractions, and attempt to replace each sentence with every single one of those
(try to do a replace of every sentence with every misspelling,correctspelling pair). Current method:
break every sentence into words and check whether the word exists in the mispellings or contractions
dictionary (dict element testing is O(1) time), and replace it only if that exists as a key.

      will always be valid, instead of having out of date IDs).

summary:     Making some massive schema changes. Moving to hashes of date+sentence for sentence IDs
instead of integer IDs. This is because right now, each time you crawl, it starts generating
integers at 1 to give to each sentence as setnence ID. However, if you want to completely recrawl
the forum, this will generate a new set of IDs starting at 1but  these IDs will no longer match the
setnences in the ground truth table which had IDs from a different run with a different
number/ordering of sentences. The goal is to be able to recrawl at any time without having to change
the ground truth table.
